3-Floor Network Design Project – SLIIT
Project Overview

This project presents a detailed network design for a 3-floor building, focusing on creating a robust, scalable, and efficient network infrastructure. The network has been designed to meet the connectivity needs of academic and administrative operations while ensuring high availability, security, and performance.

The design includes all necessary components such as routers, switches, access points, IP addressing schemes, and logical/physical topology.

Files Included

. Academic building network main.pdf – The main report detailing the network design, including design rationale, topology diagrams, IP addressing, and other key specifications.

. NETWORK DESIGN3.pkt – The Packet Tracer file used to simulate the network and validate connectivity, configuration, and performance.

. NEW DCN1.pdf – Additional documentation or design diagrams supporting the main report, including floor-wise layouts and device placements.

Objectives

. To design a scalable and efficient network for a 3-floor building.

. To provide clear documentation of the network topology, addressing, and configuration.

. To simulate the network using Cisco Packet Tracer to verify functionality.

. To ensure redundancy, security, and proper traffic management within the network.

Project Features

. Hierarchical Network Design: Core, distribution, and access layers for efficient traffic management.

. IP Addressing Scheme: Structured and organized addressing for all devices across floors.

. Network Devices: Proper selection of routers, switches, and wireless access points for optimal performance.

. Simulation: Full network simulation in Packet Tracer to test connectivity, routing, and troubleshooting.

. Scalability: Design allows easy expansion for additional floors or devices in the future.

How to Use

1. Open NETWORK DESIGN3.pkt in Cisco Packet Tracer to explore the network topology and simulate traffic.

2. Refer to Academic building network main.pdf for detailed design explanations, floor-wise plans, and device configurations.

3. Use NEW DCN1.pdf for additional diagrams, alternative layouts, or supplemental network details.

Key Considerations & Challenges

. Ensuring seamless connectivity across multiple floors.

. Proper IP allocation to avoid conflicts and enable smooth routing.

. Selecting the right mix of devices for cost-efficiency and performance.

. Managing network traffic and redundancy to minimize downtime.

Conclusion

This network design project demonstrates the planning, implementation, and simulation of a multi-floor academic building network. The design emphasizes scalability, security, and reliability, making it suitable for real-world academic or administrative environments.
